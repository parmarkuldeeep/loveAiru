My Beloved Airu,

Even across the miles that separate us, my thoughts always find their way to you. In the quiet moments of my day, I’m reminded of how deeply you’ve become a part of my world. Your voice—though heard from afar—brightens my days, and your smile, even through a screen, has the power to chase away any darkness around me.

There’s a special comfort in loving you from a distance, a connection that feels stronger than the space between us. Your kindness, your warmth, and the way you make me feel cherished—even from miles away—mean more to me than words can express. With you, life doesn’t just feel bearable; it feels meaningful, hopeful, and beautifully alive.

Our journey together is a tapestry woven with late-night calls, shared dreams, and the silent understanding that distance can’t weaken what’s real. Every moment we’ve shared—every message, every laugh, every “I miss you”—is a precious thread in the story we’re writing together. You’ve become my home, even though we’re far apart—the place where my heart feels safe, understood, and completely alive.

So here, in these simple words, know this: my love for you grows stronger with each passing day. You are the poetry my heart whispers across the distance, the story my soul is proud to tell. And I look forward to every future chapter—especially the one where the distance finally fades and I can hold you close.

Always Yours,
